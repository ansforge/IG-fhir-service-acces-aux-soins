Usage:

* document : the date the document was created. Note: the composition may predate the document, or be associated with multiple documents. The date of the composition - the authoring time - may be earlier than the document assembly time
* message : the date that the content of the message was assembled. This date is not changed by middleware engines unless they add additional data that changes the meaning of the time of the message
* history : the date that the history was assembled. This time would be used as the _since time to ask for subsequent updates
* searchset : the time that the search set was assembled. Note that different pages MAY have different timestamps but need not. Having different timestamps does not imply that subsequent pages will represent or include changes made since the initial query
* transaction | transaction-response | batch | batch-response | collection : no particular assigned meaning

","Digital Signature","Digital Signature - base64 encoded. XML-DSig or a JWT.","The signature could be created by the ""author"" of the bundle or by the originating device.   Requirements around inclusion of a signature, verification of signatures and treatment of signed/non-signed bundles is implementation-environment specific.","A Signature holds an electronic representation of a signature and its supporting context in a FHIR accessible form. The signature may either be a cryptographic type (XML DigSig or a JWS), which is able to provide non-repudiation proof, or it may be a graphical image that represents a signature or a signature process. This element allows capturing signatures on documents, messages, transactions or even search responses, to support content-authentication, non-repudiation or other business cases. This is primarily relevant where the bundle may travel through multiple hops or via other mechanisms where HTTPS non-repudiation is insufficient.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Bundle.signature",0,1,"ele-1
